## Summary 

A deep learning, kernel based, collaboration filtering technique:

As the web becomes more and more popular the ability to accurately and effectively recommend users with any type of media is critical. One popular and effective way to recommend users is the collaboration filtering technique which consists in “similarity measures between users and/or items” [1]. This paper explores a modified collaboration filtering technique that attempts to include implicit biases within ratings of other items and users unrelated to the ones in question except through a specific similarity measure. These biases were intended to be uncovered using a neural network. The process was led out using one fully connected network and one convolution network. Unfortunately results do not indicate an effective method using the explored neural network although the process yields other more effective results.

## Requirements
Keras

Theano

Python3

Netflix Prize Data Set

## Notes

Has some sample data that can be used to test the preprocessing but not the processing.

## Original code was done in single file and horribly unorganized, git progress is incorrect and was pushed in 1 day
